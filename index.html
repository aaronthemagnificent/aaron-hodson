                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <br>
                <p>I will be a Freshman at the University of Dayton studying Computer Science. I hope to graduate in five years with a bachelor's and a master's degree. I was a part of the Supportive Peers program in high school where I put in over 300 hours in one year and would love to continue that type of community work as I continue in my life. I love to help people learn and to learn myself.</p>
                <p>Other experiences of mine include my involvement with Model UN where my first year I received the Honorable delegate award. I founded a Dungeons and Dragons club at my school and helped create a system that will continue although I've graduated. I was also a part of the Peer Tutors program where I put in over 1000 hours in my high school career. I won two class-wide awards, receiving Top English and Top Computer Science, ranking among the highest in the school. I was the only person in my class to receive the Top Computer Science award.</p>
                <p>While I plan to pursue Computer Science as my career I love to write and do so in my spare time, hoping that one day that can become a full-time pursuit of mine. I also love to teach people and might change course to become an educator of either Computer Science or English.</p>
